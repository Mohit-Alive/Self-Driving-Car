# Self-Driving Car Project

Welcome to my Self-Driving Car project! This project represents the culmination of my efforts to develop a car that can autonomously navigate its environment using only JavaScript, without the use of any external libraries. Below, you'll find an overview of the skills and knowledge I've gained throughout this journey.

## Introduction

Throughout this project, I've gained invaluable skills and knowledge, including:
- Implementing car driving mechanics
- Defining and creating the driving environment
- Simulating sensors to gather real-time data
- Detecting and handling collisions
- Developing and training a neural network to control the car autonomously

It's been an incredible journey learning the intricacies of neural networks and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems. Seeing the car navigate its environment and make decisions on its own has been incredibly rewarding.

## Features

- **Car Driving Mechanics:** Implementation of basic driving functions such as acceleration, braking, and steering.
- **Driving Environment:** Creation of a realistic driving environment with lanes, obstacles, and boundaries.
- **Sensor Simulation:** Real-time data gathering through simulated sensors.
- **Collision Detection:** Handling and responding to collisions with the environment and other objects.
- **Neural Network Control:** Training a neural network to autonomously control the car based on sensor inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The entire project is developed using vanilla JavaScript.
